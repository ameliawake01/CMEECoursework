Project Title: Week 2 - Directories: code, data, results and sandbox.
Description: 

Code:
1. align_seqs_better.py
This is a Python script. This script runs through all possible starting points on a DNA sequence and attempts to find matches on a second DNA sequence. It then records all of the equally-best alignments and saves the output to the results directory. This script can be ran with or without arguments, it takes two fasta files from the data directory as default input when given no arguments and outputs a .csv file to the results directory. 

2. align_seqs_fasta.py
This is a Python script. This script runs through all possible starting points on a DNA sequence and attempts to find matches on a second DNA sequence. It then records the best alignment and score and saves the output to the results directory. This script can be ran with or without arguments, it takes two fasta files from the data directory as default input when given no arguments and outputs a .csv file to the results directory.

3. align_seqs.py
This is a Python script. This script aligns two DNA sequences such that they are as similar as possible. The alignment with the highest score is saved. This script takes no arguments from the command line. This script takes the DNA sequences as an input from a single external file in the data directory and outputs a .txt file to the results directory.

4. basic_csv.py
This is a Python script. This script reads in a .csv file containing multiple columns of data and writes a new .csv file extracting and appending only the 'Species' and 'Body Mass' data. This script takes no arguments and outputs a new .csv file to the same location as the original .csv file. 

5. basic_io1.py
This is a Python script. This script demonstrates how to import data into Python, read it and remove any empty lines in the file. This script takes no arguments and outputs an edited form of the the original .txt file to the same location as the original. 

6. basic_io2.py
This is a Python script. This script demonstrates how to save the elements of a list to a file. This script takes no arguments and outputs an edited form of the original .txt file to the same location as the original.

7. basic_io3.py 
This is a Python script. This script demonstrates how to store and save complex objects for later use using dictionaries. This script takes no arguments and outputs an edited form of the original .p file to the same location as the original. This script requires an additional package: 'pickle'.

8. boilerplate.py
This is a simple Python boilerplate. This script illustrates the appropriate structure of a Python programme. This script takes no arguments and does not output anything. This script requires an additional package: 'sys'.

9. cfexercises1.py
This is a Python script. This script demonstrates the use of conditionals to allow fine-grained control over a function's operations. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

10. cfexercises2.py
This is a Python script. This script demonstrates more examples of loops and conditionals within functions. This script takes no arguments and prints a string to the console.

11. control_flow.py
This is a Python script. This script demonstrates the use of various control flow tools within a standard Python programme structure. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

12. debugme.py
This is a Python script. This script illustrates the importance of unit testing and providing feedbacj to the user at each individual calculation; it emphasises the importance of 'try' and 'except'. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

13. dictionary.py
This is a Python script. This script demonstrates how to write a python script to poulate a dictionary and return keys and values stored as tuples. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

14. group_oaks_debugme.py
This is a Python script. This script contains a function that identifies any Oak species in a list by extracting all individuals with a name starting with 'Quercus'. This script excludes the header row from the data and outputs the identified Oak Genus and Species names to a file. This script takes no arguments from the command line but calls a .csv file from the data directory within the main function, and outputs a .csv file to the results. 

15. lc1.py
This is a Python script. This script illustrates the use of list comprehensions and conventional loops and compares both methods in relation to species data. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

16. lc2.py
This is a Python script. This script illustrates the use of list comprehensions and conventional loops and compares both methods in relation to UK rainfall data. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

17. loops.py
This is a Python script. This script illustrates the usage of FOR and WHILE loops. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

18. MyExampleScript.py
This is a Python script. This script demonstrates the use of functions: defining and calling them. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

19. oaks.py
This is a Python script. This script compares the use of for loops and list comprehensions in identifying species 'quercus' from a list. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

20. scope.py
This is a Python script. This script illustrates variable scope, I.e. local and global environments. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

21. sysargv.py
This is a Python script. This script illustrates the use of the argument variable 'argv' and the 'sys' module. This script can be run with any number and format of arguments (integer, character or string), and prints to the console.

22. test_control_flow.py
This is a Python script. This script illustrates the usage of unit testing, specifically the doctest module, the simplest testing tool in python for functions. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

23. tuple.py
This is a Python script. This script illustrates how to extract information from a nested tuple and output this information line by line. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.

24. using_name.py
This is a Python script. This script illustrates the use of __name == 'main': in a Python programme, and the ability to import one module into another. This script takes no arguments and prints to the console.
