This script takes one argument in the form of a .tif file and outputs a .png file to the same location as the original file. This script requires an additional package: 'imagemagick'.

11. UnixPrac1.txt
This file is to be used in conjuction with FASTA files. This script will count how many lines there are in each FASTA file, print everything starting from the second line for the E. coli genome, count the sequence length of this genome, count the matches of a particular sequence, "ATGC" in the genome of E. coli, and compute the AT/GC ratio. 

12. variables.sh
This is a bash script and it should be interpreted and run as such. This script will illustrate the different types of shell variables (and assignments). This script can be ran with or without arguments. When given arguments this script will:

- state the name of the first argument
- state the name of the second argument
- state the current value of the variable
- ask the user to enter a new string
- state the current value of the variable
- ask the user to enter two numbers separated by whitespace
- state the values entered and return their sum
