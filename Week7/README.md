Project Title: Week 7 - Directories: code, data, results and sandbox.
Description: 

Code:
1. LV1.py
This script demonstrates the Lotka-Volterra model.

2. MyFirstJupyterNB.ipynb
This is a Jupyter document. 

3. oaks_debugme.py
This is a programme that opens a csv file containing species data, iterates through the rows and prints "This is an oak!" when 'Quercus' is identified. It then writes a new csv file containing all of the found Quercus individuals.

5. profileme.py
This is a programme that does extensive maths problems in order to test profiling i.e. locate the sections of code where speed bottlenecks exist.

6. profileme2.py
This programme is doing the same functions as profileme.py however it has converted the loop to a list comprehension and replaced the .join with an explicit string concatenation.

7. TestR.py
This script demonstrates how to command Python to open and run commands in R.

8. TestR.R
This script prints "Hello this is R!" to the console.

9. timeitme.py 
This script is comparing the most efficient ways to do something specific, like squaring numbers and joining strings together (these have been imported from profileme.py), as part of a larger programme.

Data:
1. JustOaksData.csv
2. TestOaksData.csv

Results:

Sandbox:
Junk files.
